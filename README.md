# Date Range Picker Challenge

In 2-3 hours, could you implement a fake date range picker with React? You can use Next.js as the starting point (I used Create React App). What we are mostly looking into is the look & feel of the component you would go with and how great it would feel to use it. Here are a few design examples https://dribbble.com/search/date-range-picker you could use as inspiration. In terms of functionality, we don't expect the logic to be correct, e.g. fake and static dates. What would be great however is for the component to react to events so we can see the nominal user journey: open, select, close. This component would be used in a dashboard to filter the data set.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Scripts for Local Development

- `npm run build`: Builds the production app
- `npm run eject`: Ejects the app from using React Scripts
- `npm run format`: Formats the code using Prettier
- `npm run format:watch`: Runs Prettier in watch mode
- `npm start`: Starts the development server on port 3000
- `npm test`: Runs the tests in watch mode
- `npm run test:coverage`: Runs the tests not in watch mode and collects coverage
